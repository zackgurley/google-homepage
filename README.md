This is the first project from The Odin Project. The task was to replicate the Google homepage. As someone who didn't have much (more like any) knowledge of HTML and CSS beyond the days of MySpace, this was a challenge. I tried to write as much code from memory as possible, but in the end I had to rely on a lot of help and tutorials to make it happen. I learned a lot about the importance of divs, patience, googling, classes, and IDs. Hopefully I'll get better!
